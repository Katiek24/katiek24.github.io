  <p>Each city I’ve been is so different, not just in size but also in culture. I have become accustomed to the quietness of Helsinki and so far it has proven true that it does get louder as you move away from the Arctic Circle. I really enjoy being a sponge, absorbing so many diverse experiences and it's still crazy to me that we visited Copenhagen and London in 5 days. So here's a quick guide to both cities that doesn't require a second mortgage to finance it.</p>

  <h3>Before You Go</h3>

    <p>Be conscious of airline regulations when packing, especially if taking different airlines on each leg of the journey. Since we were heading south, we could get away with wearing our layers out of Helsinki and had room in our backpacks to spare. Some budget airlines like RyanAir only allow one personal item/person and charge for a carry-on bag. Also, it’s just easier to pack light in case you're staying in an Airbnb that doesn’t have an elevator or have to check out hours before your flight leaves. Traveling with just a backpack allows much more flexibility and you can always buy a tax-free bag at the airport before your trip home. Shopping bags can also count as a personal item so if you didn't get anything else, pick up tax-free liquor and local beer past the gate. The last and most important thing to remember are power adapters. The UK has different plug-ins than the European standard Type-C so check each country standards to avoid being stranded with a dead phone.</p>

  <h3>Airline Notes</h3>

    <p>There are several budget airline options that make getting cheap tickets easy if you do your research. Our most expensive ticket was just under 90 USD for the flight home from London to Helsinki, about 3.5 hrs. Definitely shop around and be advised you might have to sacrifice complimentary coffee and cookies for a really good deal. We took <b>Scandinavian Airlines</b> to Copenhagen, <b>RyanAir</b> to London, and <b>Norwegian Air</b> with a stop in Oslo on the way home. Scandinavian is great, they do provide free coffee and tea (no peanuts, darn) and allow a carry-on bag with no extra charge. The check-in was smooth, they have a functioning app and they automatically sat Paul and I together without having to pay a fee to change our seats. Norwegian also allows a carry-on bag, had a smooth check-in process and sat us together for no extra charge, although no complimentary coffee (again, darn). These are all things that are pretty standard on US airlines which makes RyanAir super shitty if you don’t know what to expect. First, I nearly flipped when we couldn’t check-in online and thought we would have to pay the <i>50 euro fee</i> for in person check-in. Turns out they wouldn’t let us check-in because we were leaving the EU and had to go through a passport check (Damn you, Brexiteers!) but it would have been nice to be notified of that beforehand. They charge a fee for a carry-on, purposely assign us seats not next to each other and then say, “Looks like you’re not sitting together even though there are dozens of unclaimed seats, pay a seat-changing fee." Once you’ve safely made it through the fee minefield and make it on board, then you’re in for an hour long sales pitch for snacks and random items you can buy at the airport. At the end of the day, it was a 30 euro ticket and I would probably do it again if the next best option was significantly more expensive.</p> 

  <h3>Copenhagen</h3>

   <p>I loved Copenhagen and wish we had spent more than half a day there. We arrived around 22:00 on Friday and our flight left at 15:30 the next day. There were a lot of nice things about Copenhagen, first being quick and easy transport from the airport to downtown. 24-hr passes are 80 dkk which is less than 13 USD and you don’t even have to scan it getting on the metro, just show it when asked. It is a little weird when your bill for a coffee and pastry is 250 but you just have to constantly remind yourself how little value a single Danish Krone has. Not to say things are cheap, I admittedly overpaid for a baby gnome at the Nyhavn Christmas Market. I just had to, okay? The people were wonderful and the energy was good, exactly how I’d expect the happiest country in the world to be. While Helsinki is cozy, quiet and laid back, Copenhagen is its livelier and more diverse cousin. <br /><br /> 
    Our Airbnb was close to the airport so after checking in, we rode the bus into town which was absolutely beautiful with all of the Christmas lights reflecting off of the canals. We were on a mission to <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/brewery/" class="class2" target="_blank">Mikkeler & Friends Brewery</a><img class="post-portrait" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32267807/33944636-70be3dae-e025-11e7-8b84-bde336dda458.jpg" align="left" hspace="30" vspace="20">so unfortunately we missed out on the main nightlife. The beer is worth a trek out of the main area but when a city mostly closes down around midnight, we should have thought about food first. Thankfully, it was a few blocks from kebab central where I had the best falafel pita stuffed with all kinds of goodies at <a href="https://www.dagensmenu.dk/restaurant/durum-bar-k%C3%B8benhavn-n?ad-id=2583" class="class2" target="_blank">Dürüm Bar</a>. Of course later I realized there was a Mikkeler bottle shop closer to the city center but we’ll just have to go back sometime. Food note, if you’ve avoided falafel because you weren’t sure what it was, just know it’s amazing and needs to be eaten whenever possible.<br /><br />
    It was nice gaining an hour the next day when we headed to the <a href="https://torvehallernekbh.dk/" class="class2" target="_blank">Torvehallerne</a> market which hosts two large buildings with food stalls and a courtyard between. One is full of fresh meats, cheeses, beer and smørrebrød. <img class="post-portrait" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32267807/33944637-70e022de-e025-11e7-91b8-77d1757a3675.jpg" align="right" hspace="30" vspace="20">Mine was sliced pork loaf with a potato salad-like topping with other unknown, delicious elements. Smørrebrød is a traditional Danish open faced sandwich on rye bread. The other food building held the wonders of pastries, coffee, breads and chocolates, all freshly baked and crafted. The Danish pastry was a far cry from the pathetic lumps of processed flour popular in American hotel breakfasts. I would have included a picture but it was too delicious and needed to be eaten asap. The coffee from Coffee Collective was also superb.<br /><br />
    Next on our short list was the <a href="http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nyhavn-christmas-canal" class="class2" target="_blank">Nyhavn Christmas Market</a>. It is so far the best market I’ve been to with its festiveness in such a picturesque setting. Sausages sizzling over hot coals, the smell of roasted nuts and glögg! Now watch out for this stuff, you might think some hot mulled wine with raisins is harmless but this 5.5% hot alcoholic beverage can hit you in the morning. I liked the 8% but figured I should stay awake long enough to make it to the airport. Some people even add a shot of rum, but again, a bit much for the morning. Plenty of cute stands with hand made goods, candies and random tchotchkes surrounded by picture book storefronts and cafes. It was wonderful and although Torvehallerne was great, I wish we had allowed more time for Nyhavn. Sadly, then it was back to the airport where we embarked for London.</p>

  <h3>London</h3>

   <p>London was amazing, until it wasn’t, and then it was amazing again. The great thing is that you can see a lot of cool stuff just by walking around. The unfortunate thing is many sites had expensive entrance fees and your dollar doesn't go far. The pound is still worth more than the euro which makes your wallet hurt without necessarily realizing it. The London Underground is reasonable for transportation and is an efficient way to see the city. In the 4 days we were there, I probably used about 25 GBP using the Oyster metro card but be warned of the pricey train ride to and from the airport. It was 20 GBP for a one-way ticket to the Gatwick Airport from the Victoria Train Station, about 30 minutes. In comparison, you can get from the Helsinki Airport to the city in less than an hour on a city bus. So anyone who thinks Helsinki and other Nordic/Scandinavian cities are expensive has clearly never been to London. Besides being pricey, if you happen to have weird hang-ups like me, here are 3 things to help prepare you and tamp down those ridiculously high expectations.</p>
    

    <ol>
      <li>London is the dirtiest city I’ve ever been to from crumbling, dingy underground stations to the poop brown Thames. Piles of garbage bags would be sitting on the sidewalk outside businesses in certain areas because apparently not everyone gets a can? Actually, London might have a real can shortage since public cans were extremely rare. There was also an appalling lack of recycling receptacles and compostable coffee cups. In fairness, it’s also the largest city I’ve been to, next largest being Chicago so maybe when a city is that big they’re doing good if raw sewage isn't flowing in the streets.</li><br />
      <li>The tap water sucked. Keeping hydrated was an unwelcome chore as opposed to welcome relief. It lacked any good mineral flavor and tasted like the source was over sanitized to make it drinkable.</li><br />
      <li>The people and their accents were not consistently great. I got yelled at by some lady with a religious pamphlet but couldn’t understand a word she said despite speaking "English". Give me a Finn with limited English any day over that accent. I expected everyone to sound lovely and polite like in <i>Dr. Who</i> or any other show on BBC but that was not the case. Politeness generally felt like it was out of obligation as opposed to sincerity, another thing I didn’t expect. Again, maybe it’s a just a big city thing.</li>
    </ol>
  
  <p>London is still an amazing, crazy and exciting city that I look forward to going back to and will enjoy it more after knowing what to expect.<br /><br />
      
  We didn’t exactly go down the standard tourist list but the one real tour we took was in the Tower of London for 25 GBP. Pricey, but it was the original castle of England, holds the crown jewels and was the execution spot for tens of thousands of traitors to the crown. There are free walking tours through Strawberry Tours and the tour guide we dropped in on outside of the Tower was really good. He sold us on actually going in! Walking on the tower walls was very cool but unfortunately the prison/torture cells were turned into a gift shop and we only saw one tower room where torture was commenced. The main thing I learned was the British were more brutal than I knew from history class. Maybe every power was back in the day but I had no idea a “civilized” kingdom would gut someone alive, burn their entrails and rip out their heart as a means of execution. I also never finished <i>Braveheart</i> which would have enlightened me to these methods before a tour. The well preserved armor and weapons collections from 500+ years ago were amazing but I was not too impressed with the crown jewels. They were so gaudy and sparkly I would have believed they were fake if I wasn’t told otherwise. Also, all I could think of were the countries they exploited to get those jewels… I don’t think I’ve had so many moral dilemmas on vacation before.<br /><br />

  <img class="post-landscape" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32267807/34000744-cdc3bb42-e0f6-11e7-889d-e97d01faf16d.jpg" align="left" hspace="30" vspace="20">If you want to see real treasures, go to <a href="https://www.bl.uk/" class="class2" target="_blank">The British Library</a> in Kings Cross where they have a room filled with Shakespeare manuscripts, Leonardo Da Vinci notes and sheet music written by Mozart. I spent nearly two hours there while Paul meandered elsewhere waiting for me to be done. I was inches from a Chinese Farmer’s Almanac from the 800s and a 1100s road map from Kyoto to Tokyo. I was in awe as I slowly walked around the room from Ethiopian Bibles depicting black Jesus to Iranian poetry. They even had the Magna Carta! If you want to see history in London, go to the library. There are other free museums as well that we didn’t get to that would be worth checking out on a second trip.<br /><br />

  Of course we went to Buckingham Palace to see the famous changing of the guard. It was a once in a lifetime experience, as in you do it once and you’re good for life. I spent most of the 45 minute ceremony moving to either side of the main gate to try and catch a few glimpses of what was going on. There were so many people and I’m short which made seeing difficult. I spent a fair amount of time watching through people's phones on selfie sticks. At the end when the bands were playing, I finally got a good standing spot right next to where they were coming out. Now that was cool. The way to do it is get there at least 30 minutes early and claim a standing spot on the huge monument across the street from the palace. It had elevation and you could see all the different guard groups marching in from both directions. Despite my struggles, it was worth doing, I just might opt to see the changing of the guard at the Royal Cavalry Museum next time. As palaces go, Buckingham has nothing on Westminster. Unfortunately, Big Ben was under construction and we didn’t have time to watch a public parliamentary debate over Brexit in the House of Commons.<img class="post-landscape" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32267807/34000738-ccfeea38-e0f6-11e7-8a5e-16aed5d2bfc4.jpg" align="right" hspace="30" vspace="20"><br /><br />

  Other things we saw were Saint Paul’s Cathedral (worth a tour on a second trip), Tower Bridge (not to be confused for the London Bridge), the Globe Theater, a street of embassies, Christmas shopping on Oxford Street, a Christmas carnival at Hyde Park and the insides of great pubs. Fish and chips were a must, plenty of British beer in overflowing pints and Indian food so good I could cry. <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/" class="class2" target="_blank">Dishoom</a> is the formal place we went (technically Iranian/Indian) but I also had Indian street food at a Christmas market along the Thames which was also amazing. Before Europe, I didn’t know vegetarian food could be so good. I could live on falafel, lentils, potatoes, curry, naan, halloumi and goat cheese. Thai used to be at the top of my list but it has been ousted. Although, we did have some pretty good Thai food in the back of <a href="http://www.churchillarmskensington.co.uk/" class="class2" target="_blank">The Churchill Arms</a> pub. My dream of riding in a double deckered bus was fulfilled and we experienced the true fandom of soccer at a very sticky pub. Manchester United was not popular and the displeasure was real when the Arsenals lost that Saturday night.<br /><br />This is just the tip of the iceberg and it would take at least a month to cover everything (maybe more!). Hopefully this helps break it down a bit to make London a little bit more digestible. You don’t have to do everything in order to enjoy yourself. Relax, be a sponge, look for hole in the wall gastropubs and side streets where you might find detours better than the main attractions.</p>

  <h3>Home Again</h3>

   <p>After 5 days of exciting new places, I was ready to be back home in my cozy neighborhood with our dog. Helsinki really does feel like home with wonderful people and natural beauty. The Nordic region suits me and I’m looking forward to seeing more of it in the next few months. I hope this helps prepare you for future adventures and happy wandering!</p>
