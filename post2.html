 <h2>A day in the life of an unemployed person</h2>
  <h4>17.11.2017</h4>
</div>

<div class="p-1">   
    <p>Since I haven’t been doing anything particularly interesting, besides getting ready for a new member of the family, I figured this would be a good post to do before my blog gets flooded with puppy pictures. My dad has asked what a typical day looks like and now that our lives are stable with a routine, here it is.</p>

    <p>7:00-7:30 alarm goes off and snooze button happens <br />
    7:45 roll out of bed into cozy clothes and walk Paul to work. Then I generally go for a run or walk around the inlet down the street from our apartment hoping to catch a glimpse of the sun. On days where it’s not completely gray, I walk really slowly to try and catch the sun coming out from behind the clouds only to get covered up again less than 5 minutes later.. *sigh* If you're from the PNW, you are all too familiar with having hope for a few rays only to be dashed by a demonic cloud.</p>

  <p>Then I’ll have breakfast, have coffee at the cafe downstairs and work on my website or Finnish. I see buying coffee as renting office space so I spend quite a bit of time there at once. I've spent upwards of 3 hours at a cafe and only left because I had to go to the bathroom and coming back would have been awkward. 4 euros for 3 hours of forced concentration with optimal sound levels seems fair to me. If I could focus otherwise do you think I would ever leave my apartment? No, the answer is no.</p>

  <p>Having nothing too exciting to write about isn’t the only reason why I haven’t posted in awhile. I’m also working on my dev skills so my blog looks and functions better. For my fellow unemployed readers, or those who are just bored and looking for a creative outlet, I suggest taking free HTML and CSS lessons from Codecademy. That’s how I started and I enjoy having the constant challenge of creating something from the code sheets up. I’m stubborn and have a compulsion to make more work for myself, but if I was a normal person, I would have used Bootstrap which is a good tool for formatting. Building your own website, even if you never publish it, is a good way to have fun and develop marketable skills that anyone with a computer can do.</p>

  <p>Besides that, I do normal boring house things like laundry. It's funny how weirded out Paul gets when I hang up clothes around the apartment since we don't have a dryer. I grew up hang drying everything so I think it's homey. I have to go grocery shopping practically every other day because there’s only so much I can carry in my t-rex arms and I usually forget something or don’t get "fun food". See, the number of meals I make is less than 5 if you don’t count the variations of sandwiches and pasta. It’s not that I <i>can't</i> make more interesting things, I just simply am not creative enough nor have the burning desire for variety. I find Pinterest an annoying mind drain, I’d much rather creep on what’s going on at home using Facebook. Yes, they’re evil, but I like seeing peoples’ new dogs or travel pics so, you know.</p>

<p>But now, we’re about to get a new member of the family! Below is Stitch, (we actually haven’t agreed to that name but I like it) our beautiful baby husky to be. Now I know we should have adopted instead of supporting the evil practice of breeding. For the record, his parents are their personal dogs so we’re not complete monsters and they are below as well. Adoption is also pretty difficult to do here because Finland is not only a land of reindeer and lingonberry pizza but also a land of responsible dog owners who spay and neuter. Finland has international organizations that connect Finns with dogs from overcrowded shelters in Estonia, Russia and other Baltic States. It can take 3-4 months and some of the requirements for larger breeds can be difficult to meet for a young couple in an apartment in Helsinki. For those thinking that we <i>should</i> have been stopped from buying a husky, all I have to say is that no one would be complaining if I was having an actual child which would be way more irresponsible of me. This is the perfect climate for dogs with thick coats and it would be wasted on some tiny, hairless dog who needs a parka once November hits. I digress. We had looked on Tori.fi (Finland’s Craigslist) but were unable to agree on the few that weren’t puppies from a breeder. In those cases where the owner couldn’t take care of them anymore, they had requirements like having to take two dogs together, a yard, weren’t good with other dogs or cats, had to go to a home where the previous owner could easily visit the dog, etc. Those aren’t terrible things but not what we were ready to sign up for, especially the anti-social piece. I’m relying on my dog to make me friends at the dog parks in our area, I can’t let his bad behaviour ruin my chances! So there you have it, the explanation of why a staunch believer in adoption turned around and supported the purchase of new puppy. Finland changes you, man.<br /><br />

Obviously my routine will change with Stitch, but that will just mean more walks, outdoor playtime, and LOTS of training. Our little guy will be joining us on many adventures which I’ll share as regularly as I can because he's going to be the best part of my blog. Thanks for reading so far and happy wandering.</p>
