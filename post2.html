 <h2>A day in the life of an unemployed person</h2>
  <h4>17.11.2017</h4>
</div>

<div class="p-1">   
    <p>Since I haven’t been doing anything particularly interesting, I figured this would be a good post to do before my blog gets flooded with puppy pictures. My dad has asked what a typical day looks like for me and it's probably not a whole lot different than if I was at home and unemployed. So he might as well have said, "What the hell do you do all day?" Now that we are done with immigration stuff and have our own apartment, here is what being unemployed looks like for me.</p>

    <p>7:00-7:30, alarm goes off and snooze button happens. 7:45, roll out of bed into cozy clothes and walk Paul to work. Then I usually go for a run or walk around the inlet down the street from our apartment hoping to catch a glimpse of the rising sun. On mornings when it’s not completely gray, I walk really slowly to get my sun exposure for the day in case the clouds subside, even if it's only for 5 minutes until it gets covered again.. *sigh* If you're from the PNW, you are all too familiar with having hope for a few rays only for it to be dashed by a demonic cloud.</p>

<div class="p-1">
  <p>I’ll have coffee at the cafe downstairs and work on my website/blog or Finnish. I see buying coffee as renting office space so I spend quite a bit of time there at once. I've spent upwards of 3 hours at a cafe and only left because I felt weird leaving my stuff at a table when it was getting busy. 4 euros for 3 hours of forced concentration with optimal sound levels seems fair to me. If I could focus otherwise, do you think I would ever leave my apartment? No, the answer is no.</p>

  <p>Besides that, I do normal boring house things like cleaning and laundry. It's funny how annoyed Paul gets when I hang up clothes around the apartment since we don't have a dryer. I grew up hang drying everything so I think it's homey. I have to go grocery shopping practically every other day because I have t-rex arms, I usually forget something or don’t get "fun food". The number of meals I make is less than 5 if you don’t count the variations of sandwiches and pasta. It’s not that I <i>can't</i> make more interesting things, I just simply am not creative enough nor have the burning desire for variety. I find Pinterest an annoying mind drain, I’d much rather creep on what’s going on at home using Facebook. Yes, they’re evil, but I like seeing peoples’ new dogs and travel pics so, you know. My "free time" (which is basically all the time) is generally spent moping and feeling lame for not really doing anything. Just because I'm in a different country doesn't mean everything is exciting all the time, being jobless sucks regardless of where you are in the world.</p>

  <p>In case anyone's wondering about how one goes about getting a job in Finland, all you need to know is that learning Finnish is a basic requirement. Try the Finnish pronunciations of 'j', 'y' and 'u' and you'll understand why I'll be happy if I can read a newspaper by the time we leave. Don't even get me started on dipthongs, genetive vs partitive cases or consonant gradations. I've been working through a grammar book to prep for an online course starting next week and it's been rough.</p>

<p>But now, we’re about to get a new member of the family! Below is Stitch, our beautiful baby husky to be (we actually haven’t agreed to that name but I like it). Now I know we should have adopted instead of supporting the evil practice of breeding. For the record, his parents are their personal dogs so we’re not complete monsters and they are below as well. Adoption is also pretty difficult to do here because Finland is not only a land of reindeer and lingonberry pizza but also a land of responsible dog owners who spay and neuter. Finland has international organizations that connect Finns with dogs from overcrowded shelters in Estonia, Russia and other Baltic States. It can take 3-4 months and some of the requirements for larger breeds can be difficult to meet for a young couple in an apartment in Helsinki. For those thinking that we <i>should</i> have been stopped from buying a husky, all I have to say is that no one would be complaining if I was having an actual child which would be way more irresponsible of me. This is the perfect climate for dogs with thick coats and it would be wasted on some tiny, hairless dog who needs a parka once November hits. I digress. We had looked on Tori.fi (Finland’s Craigslist) but were unable to agree on the few that weren’t puppies from a breeder. In the cases where an owner couldn’t take care of their dog anymore, they had requirements like having to take two dogs together, a yard, weren’t good with other dogs or cats, had to go to a home where the previous owner could easily visit the dog, etc. Those aren’t terrible things but not what we were ready to sign up for, especially the anti-social piece. I’m relying on my dog to make me friends at the dog parks in our area, I can’t let his bad behaviour ruin my chances! So there you have it, the explanation of why a staunch believer in adoption turned around and supported the purchase of a new puppy. Finland changes you, man.<br /><br />

Obviously my routine will change with 'Stitch', but that will just mean more walks, outdoor playtime, and LOTS of training. Our little guy will be joining us on many adventures which I’ll share as regularly as I can because he's going to be the best part of my blog. Thanks for reading so far and happy wandering.</p>
