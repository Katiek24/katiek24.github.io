  <h3>20-something wandering around</h3>

<div class="p-1">
  <p>After graduating with a business degree from the University of Washington-Tacoma, I up and moved with my partner to St. Paul MN when he got a crazy good job offer. (Now I realize I'm the crazy one for allowing this to happen!) Last year I worked at a Midwest financial firm and volunteered at Prepare+Prosper as a tax preparer. Now I'm in Finland and waiting to see what happens next.</p>

<h3>Qualifications?</h3>

<div class="p-1">
  <p>I've become a sort of Jill of all trades throughout my few years of adulthood. Public speaking, research, customer service, leadership and other random things you pick up along the way after graduating college. In other words: I love to talk, obsessively Google any thought that comes to mind, human behavior fascinates me and I am an overly self confident individual. But now I've learned a real skill, basic web development. What started as a way to pass the time became a new way to exacerbate my OCD. I don't want to talk about how long it took to settle on a background color...</p>
