<h2>Happy Fall!</h2>

   <h4>27.10.2017</h4>
   
<div class="p-1">   
    <p>Oh for the love of fall! Live wrestling, enjoying crisp walks, first snow in Finland and gearing up for Christmas. Okay, first I must say that I have never been one to skip over holidays. I have always believed Christmas decorations go up the day after Thanksgiving so those pumpkins better stay out until then. But since Finland obviously doesn’t have Thanksgiving and Halloween hasn’t fully caught on, it’s all about decking the halls in October. Christmas is Finland’s thing, they are the home of Santa, Nordic solstice traditions and they raise reindeer for Christ’s sake. Instead of elves, Ikea has a large selection of gnomes which of course meant that I bought multiple. (Paul disagrees with the need for gnomes but I’m only getting started.;) </p>

  <p>Another big deal is the 100th anniversary of Finland’s Independence coming up on December 6th. I’m a little embarrassed to admit Finland having to gain independence was new information for me. Learning about what they went through to gain and maintain their independence made me appreciate this country a lot more. It also made me think of our own Independence Day when rich slave owners declared all men were created equal and their right for freedom... I wonder if our founding fathers knew the meaning of irony. Anyways, in case anyone is interested in learning a bit about Finland’s history as well, this is a good link: <a href="https://finland.fi/life-society/main-outlines-of-finnish-history/" class="class2" target="_blank">Finland.fi</a>.</p>

<ol id="lists">Fun Finnish Facts:
  </br></br>
    <li>While under Russian control, Finland gained statehood and had more autonomy than when previously controlled by Sweden.</li>
     </br> 
    <li>Finnish women were the first in Europe allowed to vote in 1906, 11 years before they became an independent nation.</li>
      </br>
    <li>During World War II, Russia invaded Finland and the Finnish Army fought back on skis! Here's a link to some amazing pictures, the first one will make you laugh: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/05/finland-in-world-war-ii/100519/" class="class2" target="_blank">Finland WII</a>.</li>
      </br>
    <li>Tarja Halonen was the 11th and first female president of Finland and served two, 6-year terms from 2000-2012.</li>
      </br>

  <p>Before I conclude, I do have to correct a few comments I made on my last post regarding street harassment in Finland. I ignorantly dismissed it simply because I haven’t experienced it. Paul’s co-worker was creepily followed downtown over the summer and another Finnish co-worker was walking down the street with his friend when this guy yelled, “You’ll never get married with hair like that!” after she dyed her hair. Sure, that might not sound <i>that</i> bad especially if you're used to a lot worse. But it’s not what men say or don’t say that makes street harassment unacceptable, it’s the fact perpetrators completely disregard how it makes women feel. Furthermore, anything that must be rationalized as "not <i>that</i> bad" is probably bad. Finland actually has one of the highest rates of sexual harassment in Europe. 71% of women in Finland have experienced sexual harassment while the EU average is 55% <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/survey-data-explorer-violence-against-women-survey" class="class2"target="_blank">(EU FRA, 2012)</a>. Despite being ranked 3rd for gender equality in the world <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/economies/#economy=FIN" class="class2" target="_blank">(WE Forum, 2015)</a>, it falls behind most of its European counterparts when it comes to how women are treated in their daily lives. Misogyny is a world problem that everyone needs to keep working on.</p>

  And because I don’t like ending on that note, here is my new gnome family. That’s it for this week, happy wandering!</p>
